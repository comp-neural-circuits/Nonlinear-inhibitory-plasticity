# Nonlinear-inhibitory-plasticity

This repository contains the code from the publication:

Miehl C, Gjorgjieva J (2022) Stability and learning in excitatory synapses by nonlinear inhibitory plasticity. PLoS Computational Biology 18(12):e1010682. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010682

We provide the code for each figure and supplementary figure separetly from the publication seperatly. Running the code in Matlab will generate the respective figure.
